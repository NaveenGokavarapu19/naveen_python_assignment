Please follow the standard response codes and method types for all the APIs.
Application should have proper comments.
Create a Readme file to explain how to start/deploy the server application.
Setup a MySQL database to store all the required data. This database should run on a MySQL server which will be independent of Python application. You must create a SQL file which have queries for the creation of database, tables, triggers, views, etc. The initialization of database on the MySQL server should be done by executing this SQL file.
